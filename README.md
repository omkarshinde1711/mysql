# 💾 SQL Practice Solutions

This repository contains my collection of SQL solutions from various coding platforms:

- 📘 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- 📗 [GeeksforGeeks (Coming Soon)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- 📙 [HackerRank (Coming Soon)](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

All SQL problems are organized by platform inside the `sql/` directory.

## 📁 Repository Structure
    
    sql/
    ├── leetcode/ # SQL problems from LeetCode
    ├── gfg/ # (Coming soon) SQL problems from GeeksforGeeks
    └── hackerrank/ # (Coming soon) SQL problems from HackerRank


Each folder contains `.sql` files named after the problem title or number, where possible.

## 🔄 Syncing from LeetCode Repo

The `leetcode/` folder is automatically synced from my [LeetCode repository](https://github.com/omkarshinde1711/LeetCode), specifically from its `database/` folder, using a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Whenever changes are pushed to the `database/` folder in that repo, the files are automatically copied here to keep things updated.

---

## ✅ Usage

You can open and run any `.sql` file in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or an online compiler like [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)).

## 📌 Notes

- These solutions use **standard SQL** or **MySQL syntax** unless specified.
- Naming conventions may follow problem titles or IDs for clarity.
- More platforms and categorization coming soon.
